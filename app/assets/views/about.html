      As the climate continues to warm, and extreme weather events are more
      frequent and stronger, New York City must adapt to these changes to
      maintain the health and well-being of its population. Green roofs can be
      part of the solution; they can reduce local temperatures , absorb
      stormwater, and transform otherwise fairly inhospitable spaces into
      habitat for local biodiversity conservation. Even though the benefits of
      green roofs have been greatly studied, and a need to implement them on a
      widescale in cities is inarguable, as of 2016 less than 0.1% of NYCâ€™s 1
      million rooftops have green roofs. This page was developed to transform
      the information on green roofs into a tool that the average person and
      decision maker can visualize. It displays estimated potential rooftops for
      implementing green roofs, and calculates the environmental benefits the
      potential green roof may provide if installed.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Extensive rooftops of sedum 3-5 inches were only considered for the
          benefits calculations. A more realistic number would be 2, but that
          number was not an option in the survey data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Surface temperature reduction benefits are only felt on the green roof
          and the immediate area around it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mixed property ownership and tax-exempt property ownership were
          grouped with public ownership for practical reasons.
