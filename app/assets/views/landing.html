            "Nature plays a crucial role in the life of New York City. Green
            roofs atop the cityâ€™s buildings offer environmental, economic, and
            public health benefits to our communities. Yet, as of 2016 less than
            0.1% of the city's 1 million buildings had green roofs."

            Rooftops are an untapped resource. This project visualizes and maps
            as estimated potential rooftops for implementing green roofs, and
            estimates the environmental benefits they may provide if installed.
